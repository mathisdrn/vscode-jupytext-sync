## Installation

You can install this extension by searching for "jupytext-sync" in the Extensions Marketplace within your VSCode-like IDE.

The extension is available on both [Microsoft VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=caenrigen.jupytext-sync) and on the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/caenrigen/jupytext-sync) in case you are using an alternative VSCode-based IDE like [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com).

Alternatively, you can install it directly by downloading the `.vsix` file from the release page on the GitHub and drag-and-drop it in your VSCode-based IDE. This has the downside that you will not be notified about available updates.

The extension activates when VS Code has finished starting up (`onStartupFinished`), so it should be available shortly after launch.

## Requirements

- **Python**: You need a Python installation.
- **Jupytext**: The `jupytext` Python package must be installed in the Python environment used by the extension.
- **VS Code Microsoft Python Extension (Recommended)**: For the best experience with automatic Python environment detection, it is recommended to have the Microsoft Python extension installed ([open in VSCode](vscode:extension/ms-python.python) / [open on marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)).

## Features

This extension solves several common annoyances and provides handy features for a better Jupyter Notebook experience in VSCode:

- **Automatic Synchronization**:
  - Automatically syncs paired files (`.ipynb` and text-based formats like `.py`, `.md`) when you open, save, or close them. This ensures that your notebook and its text representation are always in sync.
  - Configuration options allow you to customize which events trigger a sync (on open, on save, on close for both text documents and notebook documents). See the `jupytextSync.syncDocuments` setting for details.
- **Seamless Notebook-First Workflow**:
  - **Auto-open notebooks**: When you open a paired text file (e.g., `.py`, `.md`), the extension can automatically open the paired `.ipynb` notebook instead, providing a seamless editing experience. See the **Editor Associations** section below for configuration details.
  - **Auto-cleanup**: Optionally delete the `.ipynb` file when closing the notebook editor, keeping your workspace clean when the text file is your primary source of truth. Deleted files are moved to trash and can be recovered. This feature is opt-in. See the `jupytextSync.deleteOnNotebookClose` setting for details.
- **Open Text Files as Notebooks**:
  - Open Jupytext-compatible text files (e.g., `.py`, `.md` with Jupytext metadata) as notebooks using the "**Open paired Notebook via Jupytext**" command. A notebook file will be created and all your edits in it will be synced to the text file(s).
- **Persistent Cell Outputs**: All files are saved to disk, meaning cell outputs are not lost when reopening a notebook, providing a more consistent experience.
- **Convenient Pairing Command**: The "**Pair via Jupytext**" command is accessible from multiple convenient locations:
  - Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
  - File Explorer context menu (right-click on a file)
  - Editor context menu (right-click inside the editor or on the editor tab)
  - Icons in the editor and notebook toolbars.
- **Broad File Support**: Supports all file extensions and formats recognized by your `jupytext` installation. The extension dynamically fetches the supported formats from `jupytext`. The `jupytextSync.defaultFormats` setting allows you to pre-configure default pairing strings for various extensions.
- **Raw Cells Support in Notebooks**:
  - Easily insert new raw cells via buttons in Notebook editor toolbar or keyboard shortcuts.
  - Toggle cells to raw format and back to default code. Keyboard shortcuts available.
- **Compact Notebook Layout**: A command to apply a suggested VSCode settings for a more compact notebook layout, similar to traditional Jupyter interfaces.
- **Python Interpreter Flexibility**:
  - Attempts are made to automatically discover Python executables that are able to invoke Jupytext. If the Microsoft Python extension is installed ([open in VSCode](vscode:extension/ms-python.python) / [open on marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)), its selected interpreter and other discovered environments (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) are considered.
  - Allows you to configure a custom Python executable path for `jupytext` if needed (via the `jupytextSync.pythonExecutable` setting).
  - You can use the "**Jupytext: Locate Python and Jupytext**" command or check the extension logs ("**Jupytext: Show Jupytext Sync Logs**" command) to see which Python environment is being used.

## Recommended Workflow

1.  **Pair your Notebook**:
    - Open an `.ipynb` file or a text file (e.g., `myscript.py`, `mymarkdown.md`) that you want to use as a notebook.
    - Use the "**Pair via Jupytext**" command (accessible from the Command Palette, context menus, or toolbar icons).
    - You'll be prompted to choose the Jupytext formats (e.g., `ipynb,py:percent`) unless disabled via `jupytextSync.askFormats.onPairDocuments`. The default suggestion is configurable per file extension using `jupytextSync.defaultFormats`.
2.  **Work in the Notebook**:
    - When you open your paired text file (e.g., `.py`, `.md`), the extension can automatically open the `.ipynb` notebook for you (see the **Editor Associations** section below to configure this behavior).
    - The extension will automatically keep the paired files in sync upon saving (or other configured events via `jupytextSync.syncDocuments`).
    - When you close the notebook, you can optionally have the `.ipynb` file automatically deleted (configurable via `jupytextSync.deleteOnNotebookClose`, which defaults to "never"), keeping your workspace clean while preserving your text file as the source of truth.
3.  **Version Control**:
    - Commit the text-based file (e.g., `.py`, `.md`) to your Git repository. This file is human-readable and diff-friendly.
    - Optionally, you can also commit the `.ipynb` file if you prefer to version control the outputs too.
    - If using auto-delete on close, consider adding `*.ipynb` to your `.gitignore` to avoid tracking generated notebook files.
4.  **Pre-commit Hook (Recommended)**: To ensure your paired files are always synchronized before committing, it's highly recommended to use the `jupytext` pre-commit hook. This prevents accidental commits of unsynced files.

    Refer to the [Jupytext documentation on pre-commit hooks](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-pre-commit.html) for detailed configuration.

## Configuration

### Extension Settings

You can configure the extension's behavior via VSCode settings (search for `jupytextSync` in the Settings UI or edit your `settings.json`):

- **`jupytextSync.pythonExecutable`**:
  - **Description**: The path to the Python executable or standalone CLI used to invoke `jupytext`.
  - **Details**: Jupytext Sync requires a Python executable with the `jupytext` package installed or a standalone `jupytext` binary.
    - _Automatic discovery_: If not specified, the extension attempts to find a suitable executable using a multi-tier resolution strategy:
      1. Active Python environment in the workspace from [`ms-python.vscode-python-envs`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-python-envs) or [`ms-python.python`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) (re-validating automatically when the active interpreter changes).
      2. Local workspace virtual environments (`.venv`, `venv`, `env`, `.conda`, `.pixi`).
      3. Standalone `jupytext` CLI on `$PATH` (e.g., installed via `uv tool install jupytext`, `pipx`, or `brew`).
      4. Discovered environments from installed Python extensions, followed by system `python3`/`python` on `$PATH`.
    - _Silent startup & targeted warnings_: Discovery runs silently on startup without intrusive popups unless the workspace contains Jupytext configuration files (`jupytext.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.cfg`) or paired documents.
    - _Manual override_: Specify an absolute path or command (e.g., `python3` or `jupytext`).
    - _Variable expansion_: The setting supports variable expansion for portability:
      - `${userHome}`: Expands to the user's home directory
      - `${env:VAR_NAME}`: Expands to the value of environment variable `VAR_NAME`
      - `${workspaceFolder}`: Expands to the workspace folder path
  - **Tip**: Use the "**Jupytext: Show Jupytext Sync Logs**" or "**Jupytext: Locate Python and Jupytext**" commands to verify which executable is being used.
  - **Default**: `""` (empty string, for automatic discovery)

- **`jupytextSync.deleteOnNotebookClose`**:
  - **Description**: Control whether to delete the `.ipynb` notebook file when closing a paired notebook editor.
  - **Options**:
    - `"never"`: Never delete the notebook file when closing.
    - `"ask"`: Always ask for confirmation before deleting.
    - `"yes"`: Always delete if the notebook has paired formats.
    - `"if auto created"`: Only delete if the notebook was auto-created by this extension via "Open paired Notebook" or by opening a paired text file with the custom editor.
  - **Details**: Deleted files are moved to the system trash/recycle bin and can be recovered. This feature is designed for workflows where the `.ipynb` file is generated from source text files (e.g., `.py`, `.md`) and the text file is the primary source of truth.
  - **Default**: `"never"`

- **`jupytextSync.syncDocuments`**:
  - **Description**: Controls on which events to attempt to `jupytext --sync` previously paired documents. This applies even if pairing was done externally.
  - **Properties**:
    - `onNotebookDocumentOpen` (boolean): Sync when opening a notebook document.
    - `onNotebookDocumentSave` (boolean): Sync when saving a notebook document. (Default: `true`)
    - `onNotebookDocumentClose` (boolean): Sync when closing a notebook document.
    - `onTextDocumentOpen` (boolean): Sync when opening a supported text document.
    - `onTextDocumentSave` (boolean): Sync when saving a supported text document. (Default: `true`)
    - `onTextDocumentClose` (boolean): Sync when closing a supported text document.
  - **Default**: See individual property defaults above.

- **`jupytextSync.askFormats`**:
  - **Description**: Controls whether to ask for pairing file formats before executing commands that may require pairing. If `false`, `jupytextSync.defaultFormats` are used.
  - **Properties**:
    - `onOpenPairedNotebook` (boolean): Ask for formats before opening a text document as a paired notebook. (Default: `false`)
    - `onPairDocuments` (boolean): Ask for formats before pairing documents. (Default: `true`)

- **`jupytextSync.defaultFormats`**:
  - **Description**: Define default Jupytext pairing formats (e.g., `ipynb,py:percent`) used as suggestions or defaults.
  - **Syntax**: Uses Jupytext's `--set-formats` string.
    - `${ext}` can be used as a placeholder for the file extension (without the leading dot).
    - `default` key: An extension set to `"default"` in the configuration will inherit the format string from this key.
    - Subdirectories: Prefix with `dir_name//` (e.g., `notebooks//ipynb,scripts//py:percent`). Paths are relative to the source file's parent directory.
  - **Activation**: Applies to file extensions recognized by your installed `jupytext`.
  - **Example Default Entry**: `"default": "ipynb,${ext}:percent"`

- **`jupytextSync.setFormatsArgs`**:
  - **Description**: Customization for the command-line arguments of `jupytext --set-formats` invocation. The order is preserved.
  - **Examples**: `["--set-formats"]`, `["--set-formats", "--some-flag"]`
  - **Default**: `["--set-formats"]`

- **`jupytextSync.syncArgs`**:
  - **Description**: Customization for the command-line arguments of `jupytext --sync` invocation. The order is preserved.
  - **Example**: `["--sync", "--use-source-timestamp"]`
  - **Default**: `["--sync"]`

- **`jupytextSync.enabledMenus`**:
  - **Description**: Enable or disable Jupytext menus and buttons in various VS Code UI locations.
  - **Properties** (all boolean, default `true`):
    - `explorerContext`: "Pair via Jupytext" in Explorer context menu.
    - `editorContext`: "Pair via Jupytext" in Editor context menu.
    - `editorTitle`: "Pair via Jupytext" button in Editor title bar.
    - `editorTitleContext`: "Pair via Jupytext" in Editor title context menu.
    - `notebookToolbar`: "Pair via Jupytext" button in Notebook toolbar.
    - `notebookToolbarInsertRaw`: "Insert Raw Cell" button in Notebook toolbar.
    - `notebookToolbarToRaw`: "Toggle Raw/Code Cell" button in Notebook toolbar.

### Editor Associations (Auto-Open Paired Notebook)

The extension registers a custom editor (`jupytextSync.pairedNotebookEditor`) that allows you to automatically open paired text files as notebooks. You can control this behavior using VS Code's `workbench.editorAssociations` setting.

#### Enabling Auto-Open for Specific File Extensions

**Via UI:**

1. Right-click a file (e.g., `.py` or `.md`) in the Explorer
2. Select **Open With...**
3. At the bottom of the available editors list, click **Configure default editor for '\*.py'...** (or your file's extension)
4. Choose **Jupytext Paired Notebook (Beta)** from the list

This will automatically configure the editor association for that file extension.

**Via settings.json:**

Alternatively, you can manually add the following to your VS Code settings to automatically open, e.g., `.py` and `.md` files as paired notebooks:

```jsonc
{
  "workbench.editorAssociations": {
    "*.py": "jupytextSync.pairedNotebookEditor",
    "*.md": "jupytextSync.pairedNotebookEditor",
  },
}
```

This tells VS Code to use the Jupytext Sync custom editor whenever you open a `.py` file. When the custom editor detects that the file is paired with a notebook (via Jupytext metadata), it will:

1. Sync the paired files
2. Open the paired `.ipynb` notebook instead

**Note**: If the text file is not paired with a notebook, or if Jupytext is not available, the file will automatically fall back to opening in the default text editor.

#### Bypassing the Custom Editor

Even with `editorAssociations` configured, you can always open a file with the default text editor by right-clicking the file in the Explorer → **Open With...** → choosing the default text editor.

### Jupytext Behavior

To configure Jupytext's own behavior (e.g., metadata filters, default formats), consult the official Jupytext documentation on [configuring Jupytext via `pyproject.toml` or `jupytext.toml` files](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html).

For example, to avoid noisy metadata in your text notebooks, you might add this to your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.jupytext]
notebook_metadata_filter = "-kernelspec,-jupytext.text_representation.jupytext_version"
cell_metadata_filter = "-all"
```

## Commands

This extension provides the following commands, accessible via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) under the "Jupytext" category:

- **`Jupytext: Show Jupytext Sync Logs`**: Opens the output channel for Jupytext Sync, showing logs which can be helpful for troubleshooting, especially for Python executable discovery.
- **`Jupytext: Locate Python and Jupytext`**: Manually triggers Python and Jupytext discovery, showing detailed information about which Python executable and Jupytext version is being used. Useful for troubleshooting environment issues.
- **`Jupytext: Pair via Jupytext`**: Initiates the pairing process for the active file or a file selected from the Explorer. Prompts for Jupytext formats based on `jupytextSync.askFormats.onPairDocuments` and `jupytextSync.defaultFormats`.
- **`Jupytext: Open paired Notebook via Jupytext`**: Opens the paired notebook (`.ipynb` file) corresponding to the text file (e.g., `.py`, `.md`) as a VS Code Notebook Editor. This is a key feature for working with text-based versions of notebooks. The text file must be first paired to a notebook (`Pair via Jupytext` or via Jupytext config files).
- **`Jupytext: Insert Raw Code Cell Below and Focus Container`**: Inserts a new raw cell below the active cell in a notebook.
- **`Jupytext: Insert Raw Code Cell Above and Focus Container`**: Inserts a new raw cell above the active cell in a notebook.
- **`Jupytext: Change Cell to default Code`**: Changes the selected notebook cell(s) to the default code type.
- **`Jupytext: Change Cell to Raw Code`**: Changes the selected notebook cell(s) to raw format.
- **`Jupytext: Toggle Cell between Raw Code and default Code`**: Toggles the selected notebook cell(s) between raw and default code formats.
- **`Jupytext: Set Suggested Compact Notebook Layout`**: Applies a set of VS Code settings to achieve a more compact notebook UI.

## Default Keybindings

The following keybindings are available when a notebook editor is focused and you are not currently typing in a cell input or output area:

- **`y`**: `Jupytext: Change Cell to default Code`
- **`r`**: `Jupytext: Toggle Cell between Raw Code and default Code`
- **`t`**: `Jupytext: Insert Raw Code Cell Below and Focus Container`
- **`e`**: `Jupytext: Insert Raw Code Cell Above and Focus Container`
- **`i i`** (press `i` twice): `jupyter.interruptkernel` (VS Code built-in)
- **`0 0`** (press `0` twice): `jupyter.restartkernel` (VS Code built-in)

## Relationship with Jupytext

[Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was created and is maintained by [Marc Wouts](https://github.com/mwouts). Jupytext Sync extension is only a wrapper around the `jupytext` command-line tool. It does not ship with the `jupytext` Python package.

Marc [endorsed](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vs-code.html) Jupytext Sync as the recommended VS Code extension. Additionally, this extensions shares the same logo as Jupytext with his permission.
